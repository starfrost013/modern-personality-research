    1. INTRODUCTION

       ImageDisk is a program which reads entire diskette images into  files
       and can later recreate exact copies of the diskettes in order to:

        - Archive diskette images for long term storage.
        - Make it possible to transfer diskettes via the internet.

       Unlike DISKCOPY,  ImageDisk is not limited to PC format disks and  PC
       type diskette drives.  It has been designed to handle any drive  type
       and disk format possible with the PCs disk controller hardware.

       ImageDisk was created to address the problem of preserving system and
       application diskettes for classic computers.  Floppy disks are rarely
       used with modern PCs,  however they are the  "bread  and  butter"  of
       classic  systems.  Without  the  system/application  diskettes  these
       important artifacts of our digital history will become silent.

       Please see the file HELP.TXT for help with common problems.

       1.2 System Requirements

          ImageDisk  requires  a  DOS  based  PC  with  an  AT  type  floppy
          controller.  Although ImageDisk will run on a 4.77Mhz  PC/XT  type
          machine,  some of the analysis functions are  real-time  intensive
          and best results will be obtained with  a  486  class  machine  or
          better.

          ImageDisk *MAY* run under versions of Windows which provide direct
          access to hardware  (Win9x),  however a pure  DOS  environment  is
          highly recommended. TSRs or other drivers which interfere with the
          real-time  operation  of  the  system  may  cause  problems   with
          ImageDisk.

          ImageDisk will NOT run  under  operating  systems  which  prohibit
          access  to  the  floppy  disk  controller   hardware,   such   as:
          WinNT/2000/Xp.

          1.2.1 Floppy Diskette Controller

             ImageDisk assumes that you have an AT  compatible  floppy  disk
             system.  Ie: one on which the data rate can be set.  If you use
             ImageDisk with a PC/XT type diskette controller,  you MUST  use
             the command line  option  LR=250  to  lock  the  data  rate  at
             250kbps.  If you do not,  then Image files will have  incorrect
             transfer rate values encoded within them.

             Without this option,  ImageDisk might  "try"  a  data  rate  of
             500kbps or 300kbps and find that  it  works  -  because  it  is
             actually is fixed at 250kbps in hardware,  and happily write an
             image file indicating the wrong value.

             NOTE:  A PC/XT controller will NOT be able to  read  HD  or  8"
             disks. It is NOT recommended to use ImageDisk with a PC/XT type
             floppy disk system.

             Also note: Many floppy controllers are limited designs which do
             not work well with non-PC formats. All PCs are NOT THE SAME!

          Details of the meaning of most command line options can  be  found
          in  "MAIN MENU COMMANDS / Settings"  in  the  description  of  the
          corresponding Settings menu options.

          1.3.1 Command Files

             You can place commonly used command line options  into  a  file
             with a .CMD extension,  and activate all of the options in that
             file by specifying the file name on the command  line.  Options
             must occur one per line.  Blank lines, and lines beginning with
             ';' (comment) are ignored when the .CMD file is processed.

            eg: ; Sample command file for DS in HD drive
                ; 40 Cylinders, double-step, translate 250<>300 kbps
                C=40
                DS=1
                T3=250
                T2=300

             Normally,  IMD will look for a  command  file  in  the  current
             directory,  which allows  you  to  easily  keep  command  files
             specific to your current task.

             You can use a  '$'  prefix to cause IMD to look for the command
             file in  the  IMD  home  directory.  This  accomodates  general
             command files that you wish to access from "anywhere".

             When IMD starts,  it looks for a command file names IMD.CMD  in
             it's home directory and if found, it will process it before any
             other command files or command line options are performed. This
             provides a way to customize the default settings of IMD to your
             preferences.

    2. MAIN MENU COMMANDS

       The following commands are available from the ImageDisk main menu, by
       pressing the bracketed letter in the command name:

       2.1 (S)ettings

          The  Settings  menu  allows  you  to  change   various   ImageDisk
          operational settings.  Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select one of
          the following settings, and press SPACE to change it's value.

          2.1.1 Drive

             Controls which physical  floppy  diskette  (A  or  B)  will  be
             accessed by ImageDisk.

          2.1.2 Cylinders

             Sets the maximum number of cylinders which ImageDisk  will  try
             to access.

             In general:  CYLINDERS should be set to the maximum  number  of
             tracks which can be stepped on your drive.

             During Reading,  ImageDisk will not attempt to analyze or  read
             past this setting.  Note that reading will still end if a track
             is found with no data before then.  (hint:  If you need to skip
             blank tracks, use the eXclusion map)

             During Writing,  this setting has  no  effect.  ImageDisk  will
             attempt to recreate all cylinders that are defined  within  the
             image.

             During Align/Test,  this setting has  no  effect  (stepping  is
             controlled manually).

             When cleaning the heads, this setting controls the range of the
             "scrubing" motion throughout which the heads are moved.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 7


          2.1.3 Sides

             Controls how ImageDisk treats the the disk as single or  double
             sided during an analysis. Has effect only for Analysis, Reading
             and manual Formatting of a disk. During Writing, ImageDisk will
             recreate both sides if present in an image.

             Available settings are:

             AS ORIGINAL :  ImageDisk will examine the disk to determine  if
             the second side contains data.

             ONE : Useful to prevent ImageDisk from detecting Side1 data for
             previously used disks with valid  but  unrelated  data  on  the
             second side. Also speeds up analysis of single sided disks.

             TWO :  Use this to force ImageDisk to try  and  read  a  second
             side.

          2.1.4 Double-Step

             Setting this option ON causes ImageDisk to  step  two  physical
             tracks for each logical track on the disk.  This  is  necessary
             when reading 48tpi (40 track)  5.25" disks on 96tpi  (80 track)
             drives.  QD/HD drives have twice as many tracks within the same
             diskette area as DD drives.

             Setting the option  OFF  causes  ImageDisk  to  step  a  single
             physical track for each logical track in the image.

             The setting AS ORIGINAL means that ImageDisk will  examine  the
             disk and determine if  double-stepping  is  required.  This  is
             available for READING only - when WRITING a disk,  you MUST set
             this option to either  ON  or  OFF.  (The  correct  setting  is
             determined by the type of drive you  are  using  and  the  disk
             image you are writing - in general,  if the disk image  has  40
             tracks in it, and you are using a QD/HD floppy drive,  you will
             need to turn this option ON - you may also  need  to  select  a
             data rate translation).
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 8


          2.1.5 R/W gap & Format gap

             The GAP lengths cannot be read from the  disk,  and  using  the
             wrong length can result in an unreadable  copy.  Unfortunately,
             determining the correct gap length can be "magic science".

             CALCULATED will use suggested values from the NEC  databook  if
             it exists for the disk format being used, otherwise an estimate
             is made based on the total track data  size,  sector  size  and
             number of tracks/sector.  This may  not  be  correct,  and  may
             result in a bad disk,  or one which cannot be written.  I  have
             therefore provided the option  to  force  specific  gap  length
             settings.

             If you have problems,  try increasing/decreasing the calculated
             value Note that in general,  the R/W gap must be less than  the
             FORMAT gap. FORMAT = total gap between sectors, R/W = gap after
             READ/WRITE - and should fall somewhere in  the  middle  of  the
             FORMAT gap.

             Sometimes when a disk is made with  an  incorrect  inter-sector
             gap size, it will read fine, however attempts to write the disk
             will corrupt it.  This is because the inter-sector gap  is  too
             small,  and the partial gap written at  the  end  of  a  sector
             overflows into the next sector.

             If you find this is happening,  and you are unable to determine
             good gap size values,  another solution is to simply  copy  the
             entire disk on the target system - this should restore  all  of
             the gaps to the correct sizes as  determined  by  your  systems
             disk driver.

          2.1.6 Format Fill

             This is the byte value used to fill freshly formatted  sectors.
             Normally,  this gets replaced when the sector data is  written,
             howver any sectors marked as  "unavailable"  in the image  will
             remain filled with this value when it is written to a disk.

             This setting also establishes  the  sector  content  for  disks
             which are low-level formatted (only) with the Format command.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 9


          2.1.7 Full Analysis

             To save time, normally when ImageDisk has analyzed a track,  it
             performs only a  "quick check"  when moving to the next track -
             If the transfer rate, density and sector size are the same,  it
             assumes the track will be the same as the last and proceeds  to
             read the sectors.  It will perform a full analysis only if  the
             parameters change,  or it encounters read errors on the  sector
             data.

             This option causes ImageDisk to perform a full analysis on each
             track - This increases the time needed to read a disk,  but may
             be required for disks with missing or oddly-numbered sectors on
             some tracks,  or sector head/cylinder values which do not match
             the physical track position on the disk.

          2.1.8 Interleave

             This controls how ImageDisk determines the Interleave factor of
             the disk being read or  written.  ImageDisk  trys  to  discover
             Interleave factor by reading the sectors ids passing under  the
             head  after  an  index  pulse,  however  for  disks  which  are
             difficult to read, this is not reliable.  The following options
             are available:

             AS READ :  Sectors are read/written in exactly the  order  that
             was encountered on the original disk/image file.

             BEST  GUESS  :  Examines  sector  order  and   determines   the
             interleave factor which most closely  matches.  Writes  sectors
             from lowest with this calculated interleave.

             1-99 : Writes sectors from lowest with specified interleave

             2.1.8.1 Interleave factor (skew) explained

                Many systems offset the physical sectors written to a track,
                so that extra sectors occur  between  sequentially  numbered
                sectors,  providing extra time for the CPU to  process  data
                between sequential reads.  For example,  consider a 9-sector
                disk:
                    1:1 Interleave:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
                    2:1 Interleave:   1   6   2   7   3   8   4   9   5

                The 1:1 interleave disk will require only one disk  rotation
                to read all sectors,  but only if the CPU is fast enough  to
                be ready for a new  sector  IMMEDIATELY  after  reading  the
                previous one.  If the CPU is not that fast,  it will take  9
                revolutions.  The 2:1 interleave disk takes two  revolutions
                to read all sectors,  but it allows an extra "sectors worth"
                of time between reads.

          2.1.9 Retries

             This controls the number of times that a disk operation will be
             retried.

             After one set of retries,  ImageDisk will  normally  re-analyze
             the  disk  to  determine  of  the  track  format  has  changed.
             Retries=0 is a special case which prevents this from happening.
             This is useful if you want to quickly scan the disk to  extract
             readable sectors only.

          2.1.10 Keep bad sectors

             This setting causes IMD to try and recover  data  from  sectors
             which were read with data errors (bad CRC).  When ON,  IMD will
             record data from bad sectors along with a flag indicating  that
             the sector is bad.  When OFF,  IMD will discard the sector  and
             report it as unavailable.

             NOTE:  IMD will warn you if you recreate a disk containing  bad
             sectors,  however it is not reasonably  possible  to  make  the
             newly written sector appear bad on the disk.  If you later read
             the disk the data will still be in error,  however it will read
             as a good sector!

          2.1.11 Data rate translations

             Data rate translation allows you to try to recreate a disk on a
             different drive type from that on which it was originally read.

             The most common/useful translations are:

                250 -> 300      = Read on 5.25 DD, write on 5.25 HD **
                300 -> 250      = Read on 5.25 HD **, write on 5.25 DD

            ** Normally you would also enable Double-Step on the HD drive.

             You can see the transfer  rates  in  an  image  with  the  IMDU
             utility.

       2.2 (R)ead

          Prompts for an image filename,  and a comment record,  then  reads
          the disk as defined by current settings into the image file.

       2.3 (W)rite

          Prompts for an image filename,  then writes the disk as defined by
          current settings from the image file.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 11


       2.4 (F)ormat

          Performs a low-level format of a diskette.

          Drive, Sides, Step, Format-fill and Interleave must be established
          via Settings.

          Number  of  sectors/track,  starting  sector  number,  data  rate,
          encoding (FM or MFM) and sector size will be prompted for.

          NOTE: This is a LOW LEVEL format only. ImageDisk does not know how
          to establish a file system  (high level format)  for any operating
          system.  If you want to automatically create high-level  formatted
          disks for a certain system the easiest thing to do is  to  Read  a
          freshly formatted disk and create copies from that image.

       2.5 (E)rase

          Completely erases the disk to make it unreadable.

          Drive, Sides and Step must be established via Settings.

          The PC controller has no documented capability to  erase  a  disk.
          This works by formatting the disk with a extra-long  sector  at  a
          low data- rate,  which overflows the track,  wraps and  overwrites
          the ID field, causing the track to contain no valid sectors.

          This  may  not  work  on  some  8"  drives  and/or   some   floppy
          controllers.  If this command does not work,  you may be  able  to
          achieve a similar result by experimenting with  F)ormatting  large
          sectors.

       2.6 (A)lign/test

          Performs diagnostics by continuously reading  sector  IDs  passing
          under the drive head. For each sector ID, outputs:

                <cylinder>  <head>  <sector>  <#match>  <#fail>

          #match and #fail are updated after each full revolution  and  show
          the number of ID's on the track which MATCH the physical cylinder,
          and the number of ID's which DO NOT MATCH the physical cylinder.

          At each revolution,  a tone also sounds which is higher  in  pitch
          when more matching ID's are found. This allows you to adjust drive
          alignment by ear.

          The following indicators are updated in real-time at  the  top  of
          the screen:
                    F=fault         R = ready       D = double-sided
                    W=write-protect Z = track-0

          2.6.1 Alignment/test Commands

             The  following  command  characters  can  be   entered   during
             Align/Test:

                A   - re-Analyze track
                B   - toggle Beep on/off
                D   - read Data from all sectors on track
                F   - Format diskette track
                H   - toggle Head 0/1
                I   - write $CnHn.IMD with track data (must do 'D' first)
                P   - set format/write Parameters
                R   - recalibrate to track zero/Reseek current track
                S   - toggle single/double Stepping
                W   - Write data to all sectors on track
                Z   - recalibrate to track Zero (and stay there)
               0-9  - seek to track 'n'*10 (00 to 90)
               +/-  - seek +/- one track from current position
                X   - eXit disk alignment/test function.

       2.7 (C)lean

          Although I do not generally recommend the use of "Cleaning Disks",
          sometimes you don't have time to remove and disassemble the  drive
          and these are a required immediate solution to dirty heads.

          When prompted, insert a "wet" cleaning disk and press ENTER.

          This function will  "scrub"  the disk head back  and  forth  in  a
          zigzag pattern.

          NOTE:  Make sure that CYLINDERS under Settings is set to match the
          number of physical cylinders on your drive.

       2.8 (T)est RPM

          This  function  calculates  the  revolutions  per  minite  of  the
          diskette drive.  Note that this is a simple function which employs
          only the standard DOS 55ms timer tick - The  results  will  become
          more accurate the longer you allow the test to run.

          Note that the  result  is  cumulative,  and  will  not  accurately
          reflect changes to the drive  speed.  If  you  are  adjusting  the
          drive,  press  SPACE  to  restart  the  calculation   after   each
          adjustment.

       2.9 Track e(X)clusion map

          Sometimes it is desirable to exclude certain tracks  when  reading
          an  image  (Unreadable,   Unformated,   incompatible   with   your
          controller).

          This function allows you to select  tracks  to  exclude  from  the
          image when reading/writing.  Note that tracks not occurring in  an
          image will NOT be formatted or written when the disk is recreated.

          Use the arrow keys to position the cursor on the track you wish to
          exclude, and then press SPACE to toggle between:
              = Exclude side 0 only

    3. FLOPPY DRIVE TYPES

       There are many drive types that can be connected to a PC.  Aside from
       physical media,  the charactistics which affect how a disk is read or
       written are: Number of Cylinders, Rotation speed and Transfer rate.

                    Drive type      Cyls    Rpm     Rate
                    ---------------------------------------
                    5.25" DD        40      300     250
                    5.25" QD        80      300     250
                    5.25" HD        80      360     500/300
                    3.5"  DD        80      300     250
                    3.5"  HD        80      300     500/250
                    8"              77      360     500

       Understanding these parameters and how they relate to  the  different
       drive types is very important to using ImageDisk effectively.

       3.1 5.25" Double Density

          This is the standard 5.25"  drive on most classic systems.  It has
          40 tracks,  rotates at 300 RPM,  and transfers at a  rate  of  250
          kbps.

          This  gives  it  a  normal  formatted  capacity  of   about   4600
          bytes/track,  which  gives  a  total  disk  capacity  of:  4600  x
          40(Tracks) x 2(heads) = about 360k bytes.

       3.2 5.25" Quad Density

          This drive is  very  simlar  to  the  5.25"  DD  drive,  the  only
          difference being that it  has  80  cylinders  instead  of  40.  It
          rotates at 300 RPM, and has a data transfer rate of 250 kbps. This
          makes it electrially identical to the 3.5" DD drive.

          This  gives  it  a  normal  formatted  capacity  of   about   4600
          bytes/track,  which  gives  a  total  disk  capacity  of:  4600  x
          80(Tracks) x 2(heads) = about 720k bytes.

          The 5.25" QD drive is quite uncommon on PCs, however it does occur
          on some classic systems.

          This drive can read 5.25" DD format disks by enabling Double-Step.
          Please read the note regarding track width when writing.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 15


       3.3 5.25" High Density

          This drive has 80 cylinders, rotates at 360 RPM,  and transfers at
          a rate of 500 or 300 kbps.

          At 500kpbs it has a formatted capacity of about 7600  bytes/track,
          which gives a total disk capacity of 7600 x 80(Tracks)  x 2(Heads)
          = about 1.2M bytes.

          The 300kbps data rate is for compatibility with DD/QD drives.  Due
          to the higher rotational speed  (360 RPM),  300kbps results in the
          same bit density as 250kbps on the slower (300 RPM) drives.

          At 300kpbs it has a formatted capacity of about 4600  bytes/track,
          which gives a total disk capacity of 4600 x 80(Tracks)  x 2(Heads)
          = about 720k bytes.

          This drive can read and write 5.25"  QD format disks,  however  it
          will do so at a transfer rate of 300kbps.  To create a true  5.25"
          QD image you must translate 300kpbs to 250kbps  when  reading  the
          disk, and 250kbps to 300kbps when writing the disk.

          This drive can  read  5.25"  DD  disks  by  enabling  Double-Step,
          however it will do so at a transfer rate of 300kbps.  To create  a
          true 5.25"  DD image you must translate 300kpbs  to  250kbps  when
          reading the disk, and 250kbps to 300kbps when writing the disk.

          Please read the notes regarding  track  width  when  writing,  and
          single density operation with 5.25" HD drives.

       3.4 3.5" Double Density

          This drive has 80 tracks,  rotates at 300  RPM,  and  has  a  data
          transfer rate of 250kbps, which makes it electrically identical to
          the 5.25" QD drive.

          This  gives  it  a  normal  formatted  capacity  of   about   4600
          bytes/track,  which  gives  a  total  disk  capacity  of:  4600  x
          80(Tracks) x 2(heads) = about 720k bytes.

          The 3.5" DD drive is quite uncommon on PCs,  however it does occur
          on some classic systems and a few early PS/2 models.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 16


       3.5 3.5" High Density

          This drive has 80 tracks,  rotates at 300  RPM,  and  has  a  data
          transfer rate of 500kbps or 250kbps.

          At 500kpbs it has a formatted capacity of about 9200  bytes/track,
          which gives a total disk capacity of 9200 x 80(Tracks)  x 2(Heads)
          = about 1.5M bytes.

          The 250kbps data rate is for compatibility with DD drives. At this
          data rate, the drive functions exactly as a 3.5" DD drive.

          At 250kpbs it has a formatted capacity of about 4600  bytes/track,
          which gives a total disk capacity of 4600 x 80(Tracks)  x 2(Heads)
          = about 720k bytes.

       3.6 8" Floppy Drive

          The 8"  drive is rarely found on a PC however it  occurs  on  many
          classic systems.  It has a different connector than PC drives, and
          you will need to make an adapter to connect it.

          This drive has 77 tracks,  rotates at 360  RPM,  and  has  a  data
          transfer rate of 500kbps.  Aside from being three cylinders short,
          it is otherwise very similar to the 5.25" HD drive.

          Unlike the other disk types,  8"  diskettes are physically  either
          single or double sided - the difference being the position of  the
          index hole.

          A single-sided disk has a normal formatted capacity of about  7600
          bytes per track which gives a total disk capacity of approximately
          7600 x 77(Tracks) = about 600k bytes.

          Double sided disks have twice this or about 1.2M bytes.

          Some 8"  drives may have a TG43 signal issue when  used  on  a  PC
          floppy controller.

       3.7 Writing 40 track disks on 80 track drives.

          An 80 track drive has a narrower  track  width  than  a  40  track
          drive, which means that the track laid down by the head is thinner
          than that laid down by the head in a 40 track drive.

          When writing a disk in an 80 track drive which has previously been
          written on with a 40 track drive,  some portion of the original 40
          track data will remain at the edges of the new thinner track.

          If you then attempt to read the disk in a 40 track drive, the head
          will see two conflicting signals which may cause read errors.

          It is best to use  blank  or  bulk-erased  disks  when  writing  a
          40-track image to an 80-track drive.

       3.8 Single-density and High-density drives

          I have encountered a some PCs which are  able  to  perform  single
          density operations at 250 kbps (DD drive), but NOT at 300 kbps (HD
          drive).  If you are using an HD drive and are unable  to  read  or
          write single-density disks, try a DD drive.

          I have a note on my  web  site  describing  a  modification  which
          allows an HD drive to operate at 300 rpm and 250 kbps data rate.

       3.9 Easy/Cheap 8" drive adapter

          Begin with an ISA bus connector from an  old  PC  -  this  is  the
          correct spacing for the 50 pin 8" drive, but too long. Cut down to
          50 pins.

          Salvage a 34 pin edge connector from a dead 5.25" drive - look for
          one which has a  "ground plane"  connecting the odd numbered pins.
          Leave  about  1/2  inch  of  board  under  the  connector,  remove
          components and carefully cut tracks to insure that the even number
          pins are isolated from the remainder of the board.

          Scrape away the solder mask to bare the ground plane. Position the
          "board" between the rows of pins on the 50 pin connector, centered
          from each end with the ground plane against the odd numbered  pins
          of the 50 pin connector.  Solder the odd pins to the ground  plane
          and add wire extensions to insure that  all  25  pins  are  joined
          together.

          Using 30 gauge "wire-wrap" wire,  and being careful to only solder
          to the very inner  end  of  the  "fingers"  on  the  34  pin  edge
          connector,  connect the  even  numbered  pins  according  to  this
          pinout:

            PC(34p)   8"(50p)   Description
                        2       TG43        (see Note)

                34      12      Ready

          You will now have an adapter which can be plugged onto an 8" drive
          and allows you to connect to a standard 34 pin 5.25" PC cable.

          NOTE:  This pinout connects DS1 on the PC  (the standard for  both
          drive A or B with a twisted cable) to DS0 on the 8" drive. You can
          leave the 8" drive jumpered as Drive-0, and connect it as either A
          or B at the appropriate position on the PC cable.

          3.9.1 Track > 43

             Some 8"  drives require a signal called "TG43"  which indicates
             that the drive is positioned to a  cylinder  greater  than  43.
             This is used to reduce the write current on inner cylinders.

             The diskette controller in the IBM PC  does  not  provide  this
             signal, which causes write problems on the inner tracks of some
             8" Drives.

             There are three possible solutions:

             3.9.1.1 Operating without TG43 signal

                Some drives do not require TG43.  Examine the control  board
                on your drive. If Pin 2 of the 50 pin interface connector is
                not connected, then your drive does not require TG43.  If it
                is connected,  the drive MAY require TG43 - it may also be a
                jumper  selectable  option,  please   consult   your   drive
                documentation.

                Since TG43 is used only during WRITE operation,  you will be
                able to read 8" disks.  Writing may fail or be unreliable on
                inner tracks.

                You can also try tying TG43 permanently LOW or HIGH ...  One
                or the other may allow you to create  disks  which  although
                not correct,  MAY be readable  and  can  be  copied  on  the
                destination computer to create correctly written disks.

             3.9.1.2 TG43 via modified drive cable

                The  floppy  control  chip  in  the  PC  provides  TG43  and
                DIRECTION on the same signal.  When  moving  the  head  this
                signal means DIRECTION.  When writing the signal means  TG43
                (reduce write current).

                IF your disk controller does not  "remove"  TG43 from pin 18
                of  the  interface  during  write,  and  IF  your  drive  is
                compatible with the multiplexed signals,  then  you  MAY  be
                able to provide TG43 to your drive just by  connecting  both
                Pins 2 (TG43) and 34 (DIRECTION)  of the 50 pin 8" interface
                to pin 18 (DIRECTION) of the PC interface.

                Note that although this works with some drives,  it does not
                meet the floppy  interface  standard  which  requires  these
                signals to be driven separately.  Some drives will not  work
                in this configuration.

             3.9.1.3 TG43 via parallel port

                If necessary, the TG43 signal required by some 8" drives can
                be generated with the parallel port, using this command line
                option:

                    TG=Pport[,Cylinder[,wf,wr]]

                    port        = Parallel port 1-3 or hex address  [None]
                    Cylinder    = Cylinder above which to reduce WC [43]
                    wf          = Value to write for full WC        [F0]
                    wr          = Value to write for reduced WC     [0F]

             3.9.1.4 Manual TG43 control

                If necessary, the TG43 signal required by some 8" drives can
                be controlled manually (via toggle switch).  You can set IMD
                to pause for manual  TG43  control  when  writing  with  the
                command line option:

                    TG=M[,Cylinder]

                    Cylinder    = Cylinder at which to pause write  [43]

    4. TIPS AND TRICKS

       4.1 PC floppy controllers are DIFFERENT!

          The floppy disk controller varies widely from one PC  to  another,
          and MOST PCs  have  limited  controllers  designed  only  for  the
          formats  used  on  PC  disks.  Many  controllers   cannot   handle
          single-density, or lock correctly with the small gaps used in some
          non-PC formats.

          In developing ImageDisk, I have tested with dozens PCs,  and found
          that only a few of them could read and write all the mixed density
          formats that I was able to make work.  Some  could  read  all  the
          formats  (with a high number of recoverable errors)  but could not
          write them all. The remainder could not even read all the formats.

          What this means is that you may have to try a number of  different
          types of PCs before you find  one  that  makes  a  good  ImageDisk
          system.

          The ImageDisk package includes a floppy disk controller evaluation
          program called TESTFDC - This  program  will  check  out  your  PC
          floppy controller and report on it's capabilities.  I  maintain  a
          listing  of  test  results  for  various  mainboards  and   floppy
          controllers on my classic computer website.

       4.2 Slowing the drive

          The 765 FDC used in the IBM PC has limitations which are  stricter
          than the WD 17xx/27xx controllers used in  many  vintage  systems.
          One such limitation is that the 765 cannot handle the smaller  gap
          times used on some disks, and can have trouble reading them.

          A useful trick is to slow down the drive to around 290 RPM -  this
          often allows enough extra time that the 765 controller can  handle
          the disk.

          Many disk drives have a potentiometer on the motor control circuit
          board which allows adjustment to the drive speed.  You can use the
          Test RPM function to check your drive speed.

       4.3 Identifying an image

          If you receive a .IMD image and do not know what it  contains,  or
          what type of drive it should be created on,  you can use the  IMDU
          utility to learn more about the image:

          - Hopefully the COMMENT shown at the top of the listing will  tell
            you what is contained in the image.

          - The summary near the end will show the number of tracks of side0
            and side1 information.  If the disk contains only side0  tracks,
            then it is single-sided.

          - Look at the total number of cylinders for each side, normally:
                40 = 5.25" DD
                80 = 5.25" QD, 5.25" HD, 3.5" DD or 3.5"HD
                77 = 8"

          - Look at the transfer rate, normally:
                250kbps = 5.25" DD, 5.25" QD or 3.5" DD
                300kbps = 5.25" DD, 5.25" QD read on a 5.25" HD
                500kbps = 5.25" HD, 3.5" HD or 8"

       4.4 Writing a 250kbps image on a HD drive

          When an image which was recorded on a 5.25"  DD or 5.25"  QD drive
          at 250kbps is written on a 5.25"  HD drive,  it must be written at
          300kbps to account for the  higher  rotational  speed  of  the  HD
          drive.

          You must therefore use Settings to Translate 250kbps to 300kbps.

          For images containing 40 tracks (DD), you will also have to enable
          Double-Stepping in order to write the image correctly.

          See also the note on writing 40 track disks on 80 track drives.

       4.5 Writing a 300kbps image on a DD drive

          An image which was recorded at 300kbps on a 5.25" HD drive, can be
          written on a 5.25"  DD or 5.25"  QD drive  by  using  Settings  to
          translate 300kbps to 250kbps.

          Note that a QD  (80 track)  image cannot be written to  a  DD  (40
          track) drive.

       4.6 Reading DD/QD images on HD drives

          A 250kbps DD/QD image can be read on a 5.25" HD drive,  however it
          will read at 300kbps due to the faster rotational speed of the  HD
          drive.

          If you plan to give this image to others,  it is recommended  that
          you use Settings to translate 300kbps to  250kbps  before  reading
          the disk.  This will result in an  image  file  showing  the  true
          250kbps nature of the original disk.

    5. MISC. Topics

       5.1 PC Diskette Drive Types

          ImageDisk does not know or care what types of drives are installed
          in your PC - it determines the correct transfer rate and  type  of
          stepping required by analysis of the disk.

          When writing a  disk  on  a  different  drive  type  than  it  was
          originally read on,  you may need to  set  a  data  transfer  rate
          translation. For example, if recreating a 5.25" DD disk on a 5.25"
          HD drive, you will need to translate 250kbps to 300kbps.

       5.2 DD Transfer Rate (250kbps <> 300kbps)

          ImageDisk determines the correct transfer rate for your drive when
          reading a disk,  and that  transfer  rate  will  be  correct  when
          writing the disk on the same drive,  however the transfer rate may
          NOT be correct if you write the disk on  a  different  drive  type
          than it was originally read on.

          Specifically: Standard 5.25" DD drives operate at 250kbps, however
          HD 5.25"  drives on a PC operate at 300kbps when  operated  in  DD
          mode  (this is because the drive rotates at 360rpm instead of  300
          rpm - the actual flux density transition rate on the media will be
          the same).

          A DD image read on a DD drive has a data rate of 250kbps. In order
          to write this to a HD  drive,  you  need  to  write  the  data  at
          300kbps. Use settings to select: 250 kbps -> : 300 kbps

          A DD image read on a HD drive has a data rate of 300kbps. In order
          to write this to a DD  drive,  you  need  to  write  the  data  at
          250kbps. Use settings to select: 300 kbps -> : 250 kbps

          When reading DD in a HD  drive,  I  suggest  setting:  300kbps  ->
          250kbps The image will now indicate the normal  DD  data  rate  of
          250kbps  (even though it was read  on  the  HD  drive),  and  will
          recreate correctly on a DD drive - HD users will have to set:  250
          kbps -> | 300 kbps.

       5.3 Double Stepping

          Although ImageDisk can determine that Double-Stepping is  required
          when reading a disk (48tpi disk in 96tpi drive),  it does not know
          what types of drives you are using, and therefore cannot tell when
          Double-Stepping is required when writing a disk.

          You must therefore set the Double-Stepping option  correctly  when
          writing an image back to a disk.

       5.4 Gap Lengths

          As far as I can  tell,  determing  the  correct  inter-sector  Gap
          length is mostly  "Magic Science"  ...  The NEC databook  provides
          tables of suggested gap lengths for common sector formats, however
          no material appears to exist documenting how to calculate the  gap
          lengths for non-standard formats.

          Please read the Notes on Gap Length under Settings.

       5.5 Differences from Teledisk

          Teledisk is a disk image program  from  a  company  called  Sydex.
          Until now,  it has been the best available means  to  archive  and
          share disk  images  for  classic  computers,  and  it  has  become
          something of a de- facto  standard  for  this  purpose.  Sydex  no
          longer supports Teledisk,  and is requesting that  it  be  removed
          from distribution. If you are familier with Teledisk - please note
          the following:

          - ImageDisk does not try to do everything for you - if  you  don't
            know what you are doing,  Teledisk will probably work better for
            you. ImageDisk has more user controllable settings, and can do a
            better  job  of  extracting  and  recreating  disk  images  when
            properly configured.

          - ImageDISK does not quietly generate garbage when  sectors  occur
            on the disk but cannot be read - ImageDisk will report all  read
            and write errors in the main screen log.

          - ImageDisk marks within the image when  a  sector  could  not  be
            read.
            See: ImageDisk Utility.

          - ImageDisk has a documented image file format,  which means  that
            you always have the option of exploring other means to  recreate
            a disk This is a MAJOR  problem  with  Teledisk,  and  the  main
            reason that I created ImageDisk.

       5.6 256 Tracks / 255 Sectors?

          All too often, we find a product in which some arbitrary limit has
          been imposed based on  "current standards",  that causes  problems
          with future enhancements to that standard - a good example of this
          is the floppy disk controller chips designed in the era of the  77
          track 8"  drive which generate an error if recalibrating the  head
          to track zero fails after 77 steps  (this does not work on  an  80
          track drive).

          In designing ImageDisk,  I have chosen to provide support for  all
          of the capabilities of the 765 FDC. This means that as many as 256
          tracks,  and 255 sectors/track are configurable.  It's not that  I
          expect such floppy drives will exist,  however it is  less  likely
          that ImageDisk will become "useless"  because I chose an arbitrary
          limit.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 25


       5.7 Aligning a drive

          To properly align a disk  drive,  you  need  a  special  alignment
          diskette and an oscilloscope,  however with ImageDisks  Align/Test
          function,  you can usually  get  "close  enough"  without  special
          tools.

          NOTE:  If you don't know what you are doing,  you can damage  your
          drive,  your PC and possibly yourself - Attempt this only  if  you
          are familier  with  and  comfortable  working  on  mechanical  and
          electronic hardware.

          When you execute the (A)lign/Test function, ImageDisk will enter a
          continuous read loop, providing a running display of the number of
          sectors read which match the currently seeked track  ID,  and  the
          number read which don't match.  There is also  an  audible  "beep"
          which increases in pitch the more matching sectors are found.

          How you physically adjust head alignment varies from one drive  to
          another. For some you loosen the stepper motor and rotate it.  For
          others,  you loosen the whole head carrier assembly and  there  is
          either a worm-screw or a slotted  cam  which  moves  it  back  and
          forth.

          To "best guess"  align the drive,  start with a diskette formatted
          on a known good drive. Seek to various tracks, and adjust the head
          position for the highest audible tones.  Note the limits where the
          tone starts to drop, and assume "dead center" between those limits
          is the best alignment point for that track.  Do  this  at  several
          tracks  over  the  range  of  head  movement  and  find  the  best
          compromise for all positions.  Confirm your results  with  several
          other known good diskettes from other sources.

          You should also check the track-zero  detect  switch.  During  the
          Align/Test function,  ImageDisk will show you the  status  of  the
          track-0 sensor at the top of the screen.  Make sure that it  comes
          ON when you step to track 0,  and goes OFF when you step to  track
          1. If not, you may have to adjust the sensor position.

          Note that if you have  either  the  alignment  or  track-0  sensor
          wrong,  you may not be able to adjust the other correctly.  If the
          drive is really bad to begin with,  you may have to  go  back  and
          forth between the two a few times in order to  get  to  the  point
          where you can make the correct adjustments.

    6. IMAGE FILE FORMAT

       The overall layout of an ImageDisk .IMD image file is:

         IMD v.vv: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss          (ASCII Header)
         Comment (ASCII only - unlimited size)  (NOTE:  You can TYPE a .IMD)
         1A byte - ASCII EOF character          (file to see header/comment)
         - For each track on the disk:
            1 byte  Mode value                  (0-5)
            1 byte  Cylinder                    (0-n)
            1 byte  Head                        (0-1)   (see Note)
            1 byte  number of sectors in track  (1-n)
            1 byte  sector size                 (0-6)
            sector numbering map                * number of sectors
            sector cylinder map (optional)      * number of sectors
            sector head map     (optional)      * number of sectors
            sector data records                 * number of sectors
         <End of file>

       6.1 Mode value

          This value indicates the data transfer rate and density  in  which
          the original track was recorded:

             00 = 500 kbps FM   \   Note:   kbps indicates transfer rate,
             01 = 300 kbps FM    >          not the data rate, which is
             02 = 250 kbps FM   /           1/2 for FM encoding.
             03 = 500 kbps MFM
             04 = 300 kbps MFM
             05 = 250 kbps MFM

       6.2 Sector size

          The Sector Size value indicates the actual size of the sector data
          occuring on the track:

            00 =  128 bytes/sector
            01 =  256 bytes/sector
            02 =  512 bytes/sector
            03 = 1024 bytes/sector
            04 = 2048 bytes/sector
            05 = 4096 bytes/sector
            06 = 8192 bytes/sector

          ImageDisk does not currently handle disks with  differently  sized
          sectors within the same  track  (the  PC  FDC  cannot  write  such
          disks),  however an extension to the .IMD  file  format  has  been
          suggested to allow these type of disks to be represented:

             A sector size value of 0xFF indicates that a  table  of  sector
             sizes occurs  after  the  sector  numbering/cylinder/head  maps
             (immediately before the data records) which contains one 16-bit
             value  (in little endian format)  per sector which defines  the
             actual size of that sector.
    ImageDisk                                                        Page: 27


       6.3 Head value

          This value indicates the side of the  disk  on  which  this  track
          occurs (0 or 1).

          Since HEAD can only be 0 or 1,  ImageDisk uses the upper  bits  of
          this byte to indicate the presense of optional items in the  track
          data:

             Bit 7 (0x80) = Sector Cylinder Map
             Bit 6 (0x40) = Sector Head     Map

       6.4 Sector numbering map

          The sector numbering map contains one byte  entry  containing  the
          physical ID for each sector that occurs in the track.

          Note that these entries may NOT be sequential.  A disk which  uses
          sector interleave will have a sector numbering map  in  which  the
          sector numbers occur in non-sequential order.

          If ImageDisk is unable to obtain all sector numbers  in  a  single
          revolution of the  disk,  it  will  report  "Unable  to  determine
          interleave"  and  rearrange  the  sector  numbers  into  a  simple
          sequential list.

       6.5 Sector Cylinder Map

          This is an optional field.  It's presense is indicated  by  bit  7
          being set in the Head value for the track.

          When present,  it means that the cylinder values  written  to  the
          sectors do NOT match the physical cylinder of the track.

          The Sector Cylinder  Map  has  one  entry  for  each  sector,  and
          contains the logical Cylinder ID for the corresponding  sector  in
          the Sector Numbering Map.

          Reading a disk with non-standard Cylinder ID's  will  require  the
          use of the FULL ANALYSIS setting.

       6.6 Sector Head map

          This is an optional field.  It's presense is indicated  by  bit  6
          being set in the Head value for the track.

          When present, it means that the head values written to the sectors
          do NOT match the physical head selection of the track.

          The Sector Head Map has one entry for each  sector,  and  contains
          the logical Head ID for the corresponding  sector  in  the  Sector
          Numbering Map.

          Reading a disk with non-standard Head ID's may require the use  of
          the FULL ANALYSIS setting.

       6.7 Sector Data Records

          For each sector ID occuring in the Sector Numbering Map, ImageDisk
          records a Sector Data Record - these records  occur  in  the  same
          order as the IDs in the Sector Numbering Map:

            00      Sector data unavailable - could not be read
            01 .... Normal data: (Sector Size) bytes follow
            02 xx   Compressed: All bytes in sector have same value (xx)
            03 .... Normal data with "Deleted-Data address mark"
            04 xx   Compressed  with "Deleted-Data address mark"
            05 .... Normal data read with data error
            06 xx   Compressed  read with data error
            07 .... Deleted data read with data error
            08 xx   Compressed, Deleted read with data error

    7. IMDA: ImageDisk Analyzer

       7.1 Introduction

          IMageDisk Analyzer (IMDA) is a utility which examines an ImageDisk
          .IMD file and suggests possible drive types and options which  may
          be suitable to recreate a disk from that image.

          NOTE:  This is NOT intended as a replacement for "knowing what you
          are doing".  Getting the  right  drive  type  and  settings  often
          requires knowlege about the drive type and format  information  of
          the original  system.  IMDA  will  make  suggestions  as  to  what
          drives/settings could be used to recreate an image,  but  it  does
          not know of the resultant disk is suitable for that system or your
          particular use.

    8. IMDU: ImageDisk Utility

       8.1 Introduction

          IMageDisk Utility  (IMDU)  allows you to manipulate ImageDisk .IMD
          files. The functions which can performed by IMDU are:

            - Display track/sector detail.
            - Compare two .IMD files.
            - Merge two .IMD files, extracting missing tracks and
              sectors from one to complete another.
            - Remove specific tracks/sides.
            - Translate the data rate values.
            - regenerate track data with a new interleave factor.
            - Compress/Expand "all same" sectors.
            - Convert .IMD file to raw binary .BIN format.
            - Extract, Append and Replace the image comment record.

          In general, IMDU works by reading the input-image, and writing the
          output-image, performing whatever adjustments are specified by the
          options.

          If no adjustment options are made, then IMDU performs a compare of
          the two images.  (Adjustment options are: /B, /C,  /E,  /NB,  /ND,
          AC=, F=, IL=, RC=, T2=, T3=, T5=, X=, X0= and X1=).

          If three image file names are provided,  IMDU will merge the first
          two,  combining missing data from one into the other and write the
          final combined image to the output file.  Adjustment  options  may
          also be applied during the image merge.

          The /B option causes IMDU to remove the comment and all formatting
          information,  outputting what is essentially only the  raw  sector
          content of the disk.  This is useful for many emulators and  other
          disk image manipulation utilities  which  do  not  understand  the
          embedded format information in a .IMD file.

          When using /B, IMDU automatically outputs the sector data in order
          by logical sector number (ie: removes interleave),  however if you
          wish the sector data to be output in some other order, you can use
          the IL= option to re-interleave the output order.

    9. IMDV: ImageDisk Viewer

       9.1 Introduction

          IMageDisk Viewer  (IMDV)  is a utility which lets you easliy  look
          through  the  content  of  an  image  file,  and  optionally  make
          changes/patches  to  the  content  of  individual   sectors   (not
          recommended unless you really know what you are doing).

          IMDV is a low-level  tool  which  presents  the  data  content  of
          sectors in the image file in hexidecimal dump format  with  either
          ASCII,  EBCDIC or custom character-set display.  IMDV  does  *NOT*
          understand the arrangement of files, directories or other features
          of logical volumes which may be  contained  in  the  image  (these
          things are highly operating system dependant,  and ImageDisk  does
          not assume any particular operating system created the disks).

          What IMDV does do is allow you to search through  the  disk  image
          sectors, view then in HEX/ASCII/EBCDIC/Custom, search for specific
          strings,  and also to extract and display  all  printable  strings
          occuring from a set point in the image.

       9.2 Command line options

    Use: IMDV image[.IMD] [options]

    Opts:   /C              - Case-sensitive searches
            /E              - use Ebcdic displays
            /I              - ignore Interleave in sector ordering
            /W              - allow Write to file (edit)
            C=file[.CHR]    - use Custom character-set          [none]
            E=file[.CHR]    - Edit custom character-set         [no]
            M=n             - Minimum scan-string length        [5]
            S=file[.TXT]    - extract scan-Strings to file      [no]
            W=n             - Width of scan-string output       [80]

       9.3 Custom Character Sets

          IMDV runs on  a  PC,  which  uses  the  ASCII  character  set.  It
          accomodate  the  viewing  of  images  containing  EBCDIC   encoded
          characters,  an  internal  EBCDIC->ASCII  translation   table   is
          provided.

          If you need to use a different character set,  you can  load  your
          own translation table.  This table consists of exactly 256  bytes,
          each byte containing the ASCII character which should be displayed
          when the character code corresponding to the position in the  file
          is encountered. NOTE: This is a simple byte translation only. IMDV
          cannot accomodate character sets of more than 8-bits,  nor can  it
          accomdate character sets such as BAUDOT which  use  encoded  shift
          sequences to select banks of characters.

          A  very  simple  character  set  editor  is  provided   with   the
          E=character-file option.

    10. TESTFDC - Evaluate PC floppy controller

       As noted in preceeding sections,  PC floppy controllers vary  widely,
       and it can be tricky to find a system with all the  capabilities  you
       need to backup and restore some non-PC formats.

       This TESTFDC utility evaluates the floppy  disk  controller  in  your
       system to determine how well it performs at single/double density  at
       various data rates.  It  also  tests  MFM  operation  with  128  byte
       sectors. Many PCs cannot access these disk types.  If you plan to use
       ImageDisk to archive and restore non-PC format  disks,  this  program
       should help you find a PC thats up to the task.

    Use: TESTFDC drive [type] [options]

    drive:  Physical floppy drive to test (A: - D:)

    type:   Override BIOS drive type:
            360 = DD 40 track    1.2 = HD 80-track (5.25)
            720 = DD 80 track   1.44 = HD 80-track (3.5)

    opts:   /D      - skip standard Double-density test (should always work)
            /R      - please Read this!
            R=file  - Write final report to file.
            /X      - eXclude MFM/128 test

       You will be prompted to insert low and/or high density media. TESTFDC
       only writes to the top 5 tracks of the disk,  allowing you to  use  a
       single disk to boot and to test.  TESTFDC should be run from  a  bare
       DOS boot (no windows).

       NOTE:  I am attempting to build a registry of  mainboard  and  add-in
       floppy controllers and their capabilities. The latest version of this
       registry can be found with the TESTFDC program at:
          http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/img
